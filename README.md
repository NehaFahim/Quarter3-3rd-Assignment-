## Lesson 05: Control Flow & Loops

### **Theory:**

In Python, **control flow** refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated. 

- **If statements** are used to execute code only when a condition is true.
- **Elif** allows you to check multiple conditions, and **else** is executed when none of the conditions are true.
- **Loops** allow you to execute the same block of code repeatedly:
  - A **for loop** is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or range of numbers).
  - A **while loop** continues to run as long as a specified condition remains true.

These control structures are essential for writing dynamic programs where different outcomes are possible based on varying conditions and repeated tasks.

## Lesson 06: Lists, Tuples & Dictionary

### **Theory:**

Python provides several built-in data structures to store collections of data. 

1. **Lists**:
   - Lists are **ordered** collections of items that can be changed after creation (mutable).
   - They can store items of any data type (integers, strings, etc.).
   - Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`.

2. **Tuples**:
   - Tuples are similar to lists but are **immutable** (cannot be changed after creation).
   - They are useful when you need to store a collection of items that should not be modified.
   - Tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.

3. **Dictionaries**:
   - Dictionaries store **key-value pairs** where each key is unique.
   - They are **unordered** collections and allow for fast lookups based on keys.
   - Dictionaries are defined using curly braces `{}`.

These data structures help manage multiple related values, each suited to different use cases depending on the need for mutability or key-based lookups.

## Lesson 07: The Set & Frozenset

### **Theory:**

Both **sets** and **frozensets** are data structures used to store unique elements, but they differ in mutability.

1. **Set**:
   - A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements.
   - Sets are **mutable**, meaning you can add or remove elements after creation.
   - They are useful when you need to store a collection of items and ensure there are no duplicates.

2. **Frozenset**:
   - A **frozenset** is similar to a set, but it is **immutable**.
   - Once created, elements cannot be added or removed from a frozenset.
   - Frozensets are useful when you need an immutable set for use as a key in a dictionary or for ensuring data integrity.

## Conclusion

In these lessons, we have learned about:
1. **Control flow and loops** for decision-making and repeating tasks.
2. **Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries** for storing collections of data.
3. **Sets and Frozensets** for ensuring uniqueness and controlling mutability.

These concepts form the foundation for writing more complex Python programs, and practicing these basic structures will help you build more advanced logic and functionality in your programs.
